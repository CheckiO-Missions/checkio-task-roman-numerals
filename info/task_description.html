    Roman numerals come from the ancient Roman numbering system.
    They are based on specific letters of the alphabet which are combined to signify the sum
    (or, in some cases, the difference) of their values. The first ten Roman
    numerals are:
</p>
<p>I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X.</p>
<p>
    The Roman numeral system is decimal based but not directly positional and does not
    include a zero. Roman numerals are based on combinations of these seven symbols:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Symbol Value</li>
<li><strong>I</strong> 1 (unus)</li>
<li><strong>V</strong> 5 (quinque)</li>
<li><strong>X</strong> 10 (decem)</li>
<li><strong>L</strong> 50 (quinquaginta)</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> 100 (centum)</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> 500 (quingenti)</li>
<li><strong>M</strong> 1,000 (mille)</li>
    </ul>
